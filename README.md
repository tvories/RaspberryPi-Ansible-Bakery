# RaspberryPi-Ansible-Bakery
Bootstrap Raspberry Pi using Ansible and PiBakery.

These files should allow you to bootstrap your Pi using PiBakery and Ansible.  PiBakery should lay down the OS and prepare it to connect to Ansible.  Ansible will then run on the Pi and join it to an Active Directory domain.
